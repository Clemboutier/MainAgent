# Endurance Training Primer

Consistent aerobic training builds mitochondrial density and improves fat oxidation. Long, easy miles form the base of a durable athlete. Sprinkle tempo rides or runs once the aerobic base is strong.

## Recovery Indicators

Track heart rate variability, resting heart rate, and perceived fatigue. If two or more metrics trend negatively for three consecutive days, reduce intensity.

## Nutrition

Consume 30-60g of carbohydrates per hour for workouts longer than 90 minutes. Pair with electrolytes in hot environments.
