# Nutrition Guide for Athletes

## Macronutrient Balance

Athletes should aim for a balanced intake of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. A general guideline is:
- Carbohydrates: 45-65% of total calories
- Protein: 15-25% of total calories
- Fats: 20-35% of total calories

## Pre-Workout Nutrition

Consume a meal 2-3 hours before training containing:
- Complex carbohydrates for sustained energy
- Moderate protein for muscle support
- Low fat to avoid digestive discomfort

## Post-Workout Recovery

Within 30-60 minutes after exercise:
- 20-40g of protein for muscle repair
- Carbohydrates to replenish glycogen stores
- Hydration with water and electrolytes

## Hydration Guidelines

- Drink 500ml of water 2 hours before exercise
- During exercise: 150-250ml every 15-20 minutes
- Post-exercise: Replace 150% of fluid lost through sweat
